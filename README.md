# Matching-Game
This is a matching game, which is made by Android Studio. The objective of the game is to match pairs of buttons as quickly as possible while keeping track of move counts. Upon launching the application and selecting the 'Play' button, users are presented with a game board consisting of buttons arranged in a grid. Each button contains a randomly assigned emoji. The goal is to find and match all the pairs by tapping the buttons. When users tap two buttons, the emojis they contain are revealed. If the buttons form a matching pair, they disappear, reducing the number of buttons left to uncover. Users continue tapping buttons, finding matches, and gradually revealing more pairs. The application tracks users' move counts and timer, displaying them at the top of the screen. Users are encouraged to complete the game with as few moves as possible to improve their score and challenge themselves. Once all pairs are successfully matched, the result is displayed, and users can choose to continue playing a new game by selecting the 'Continue' button. To review their progress and view previous records, users can access the 'Your Records' section on the main menu. This feature retrieves data from the Games Log table in the local database, enabling users to analyze their performance over time.
